  "readme": "# React Hot Loader\n\n[![Build Status][build-badge]][build]\n[![version][version-badge]][package]\n[![MIT License][license-badge]][LICENSE]\n\n[![PRs Welcome][prs-badge]][prs]\n[![Chat][chat-badge]][chat]\n\n[![Watch on GitHub][github-watch-badge]][github-watch]\n[![Star on GitHub][github-star-badge]][github-star]\n\nTweak React components in real time ⚛️⚡️\n\nWatch **[Dan Abramov's talk on Hot Reloading with Time Travel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs).**\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install --save react-hot-loader\n```\n> Note: You can safely install react-hot-loader as a regular dependency instead of a dev dependency as it automatically ensures it is not executed in production and the footprint is minimal.\n\n## Getting started\n\n1. Add `react-hot-loader/babel` to your `.babelrc`:\n\n```js\n// .babelrc\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"react-hot-loader/babel\"]\n}\n```\n\n2. [Enable Hot Module Replacement in Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/#enabling-hmr)\n\n3. Add `react-hot-loader/patch` at the top of the entry section (except polyfills) of your Webpack config:\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: [\n    'babel-polyfill',\n    'react-hot-loader/patch',\n    './main.js'\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> Note: Make sure to set the `output.publicPath` property to `\"/\"` as well. Otherwise hot reloading won't work as expected for nested routes.\n\n4. Wrap your application into `<AppContainer>`, all children of `<AppContainer>` will be reloaded when a change occurs:\n\n```js\n// main.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\nimport { AppContainer } from 'react-hot-loader'\nimport App from './containers/App'\n\nconst render = Component => {\n  ReactDOM.render(\n    <AppContainer>\n      <Component />\n    </AppContainer>,\n    document.getElementById('root'),\n  )\n}\n\nrender(App)\n\n// Webpack Hot Module Replacement API\nif (module.hot) {\n  module.hot.accept('./containers/App', () => { render(App) })\n}\n```\n\n> Note: To make this work, you'll need to opt out of Babel transpiling ES2015 modules by changing the Babel ES2015 preset to be `[\"es2015\", { \"modules\": false }]`\n\n## Using Webpack loader instead of Babel plugin\n\nYou may not use Babel in your project, React Hot Loader provides a Webpack loader with **[limited support](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader#known-limitations)**. If you want to use it, you can add it in your Webpack config. **If you use Babel, you don't need to add this loader**.\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.jsx?$/,\n        use: ['react-hot-loader/webpack']\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Migrating from [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)\n\n* Run `npm run eject`\n* Install React Hot Loader (`npm install --save-dev react-hot-loader`)\n* In `config/webpack.config.dev.js`:\n  1. Add `'react-hot-loader/patch'` to entry array (anywhere before `paths.appIndexJs`). It should now look like (excluding comments):\n  ```js\n    entry: [\n      'react-hot-loader/patch',\n      require.resolve('react-dev-utils/webpackHotDevClient'),\n      require.resolve('./polyfills'),\n      paths.appIndexJs\n    ]\n  ```\n\n  2. Add `'react-hot-loader/babel'` to Babel loader configuration. The loader should now look like:\n  ```js\n    // Process JS with Babel.\n    {\n      test: /\\.(js|jsx)$/,\n      include: paths.appSrc,\n      loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),\n      options: {\n  \n        // This is a feature of `babel-loader` for webpack (not Babel itself).\n        // It enables caching results in ./node_modules/.cache/babel-loader/\n        // directory for faster rebuilds.\n        cacheDirectory: true,\n        plugins: [\n          'react-hot-loader/babel'\n        ]\n      },\n    },\n  ```\n\n* Add `AppContainer` to `src/index.js` (see step 4 of Getting Started).\n\n## TypeScript\n\nWhen using TypeScript, Babel is not required, so your config should look like ([demo](https://github.com/Glavin001/react-hot-ts)):\n\n```js\n{\n  test: /\\.tsx?$/,\n  loaders: ['react-hot-loader/webpack', 'ts-loader'] // (or awesome-typescript-loader)\n}\n```\n\n## Source Maps\n\nIf you use `devtool: 'source-map'` (or its equivalent), source maps will be emitted to hide hot reloading code.\n\nSource maps slow down your project. Use `devtool: 'eval'` for best build performance.\n\nHot reloading code is just one line in the beginning and one line in the end of each module so you might not need source maps at all.\n\n## React Native\n\nReact Native **[supports hot reloading natively](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2016/03/24/introducing-hot-reloading.html)** as of version 0.22.\n\n## Adding a custom error reporter\n\nThe previously used `Redbox` for React Hot Loader has known limitations due to sourcemaps and it's no longer a default catcher. Errors are great to clearly see rendering issues, and avoiding an uncaught error from breaking your app. But there are some advantages to a thrown error in the console too, like filename resolution via sourcemaps, and click-to-open. To get the `Redbox` back, and have the best of both worlds, modify your app entry point as follows:\n\n```js\nimport Redbox from 'redbox-react';\n\nconst CustomErrorReporter = ({ error }) => <Redbox error={ error } />;\n\nCustomErrorReporter.propTypes = {\n  error: React.PropTypes.instanceOf(Error).isRequired\n};\n\nrender((\n  <AppContainer errorReporter={ CustomErrorReporter }>\n    <AppRoot />\n  </AppContainer>\n), document.getElementById('react-root'));\n```\n\nYou'll also need to `npm install --save-dev redbox-react`.\n\n## Disable warnings\n\nReact Hot Loader will by default emit a warning for components not accepted by the Hot Loader. If you want to disable these warnings, you can pass a `warnings` prop with the value `false` to `AppContainer`.\n\n```js\n<AppContainer warnings={false}>\n  ...\n</AppContainer>\n```  \n\n## Starter Kit\n\nProvided by collaborators:\n* [react-hot-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate/tree/next) (Bare minimum)\n* [react-hot-loader-minimal-boilerplate](https://github.com/wkwiatek/react-hot-loader-minimal-boilerplate)* (Bare minimum)\n\nProvided by community:\n* [react-kit](https://github.com/thomasthiebaud/react-kit) (webpack v2, redux, react-router v4, code splitting, jest, saga, reselect)\n* [hapi-react-hot-loader-example](https://github.com/codeBelt/hapi-react-hot-loader-example) (ES2015, Universal (SSR), React Hot Loader 3, React Router 4, Redux, Redux Saga, Redux Form, Async Component Code Splitting, Hapi, Webpack 3)\n* [typescript-hapi-react-hot-loader-example](https://github.com/codeBelt/typescript-hapi-react-hot-loader-example) (TypeScript, Universal (SSR), React Hot Loader 3, React Router 4, Redux, Redux Saga, Redux Form, Async Component Code Splitting, Hapi, Webpack 3)\n* [react-redux-styled-hot-universal](https://github.com/krasevych/react-redux-styled-hot-universal) (SSR, Universal Webpack, Redux, React-router, Webpack 2, Babel, Styled Components and more...)\n* [webpack-react-redux](https://github.com/jpsierens/webpack-react-redux) (redux, react-router, hmr)\n* [react-lego](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego) (universal, react-router, other optional techs)\n* [react-static-boilerplate](https://github.com/koistya/react-static-boilerplate) (static site generator;

Instead, you'll need to define it once:\n\n```js\nconst App = () => (<div>hello</div>);\nexport default connect()(App);\n```\n\n### Decorators\n\nComponents that are decorated (using something like [`@autobind`](https://github.com/andreypopp/autobind-decorator)) currently do not retain state when being hot-reloaded. (see [#279](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/279))\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf it doesn't work, in 99% cases it's a configuration issue.\nA missing option, a wrong path or port. Webpack is very strict about configuration, and the best way to find out what's wrong is to compare your project to an already working setup, such as **[React Hot Boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate)**, bit by bit.\n\nIf something doesn't work, in 99% cases it's an issue with your code - Component doesn't got registered, due to HOC or Decorator around it, which making it invisible to Babel plugin, or Webpack loader.  \n\nWe're also gathering **[Troubleshooting Recipes](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md)** so send a PR if you have a lesson to share!\n\n## [Patrons](PATRONS.md)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n[build-badge]: https://img.shields.io/travis/gaearon/react-hot-loader.svg?style=flat-square\n[build]: https://travis-ci.org/gaearon/react-hot-loader\n[version-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-hot-loader.svg?style=flat-square\n[package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hot-loader\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/l/react-hot-loader.svg?style=flat-square\n[license]: https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/LICENSE\n[prs-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square\n[prs]: http://makeapullrequest.com\n[chat]: https://gitter.im/gaearon/react-hot-loader\n[chat-badge]: https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/gaearon/react-hot-loader.svg?style=flat-square\n[github-watch-badge]: https://img.shields.io/github/watchers/gaearon/react-hot-loader.svg?style=social\n[github-watch]: https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/watchers\n[github-star-badge]: https://img.shields.io/github/stars/gaearon/react-hot-loader.svg?style=social\n[github-star]: https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/stargazers\n",
